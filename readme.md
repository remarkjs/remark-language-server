## What is this?

This package is a [language server][] which can lint and format markdown files
using remark.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package when you want to enhance your editor with linting and
formatting of markdown files.
Some editors can consume this package directly, others need a plugin in order to
consume this package.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
In Node.js (version 14.14+, 16.0+, or 18.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-language-server
```

## Use

Usage of this package depends on your editor integration.
Because this is based on
[`vscode-languageserver-node`][vscode-languageserver-node], the same transports
are supported.

Practical examples are coming soon.

`remark-language-server` uses the same configuration files as
[`remark-cli`][remark-cli].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 14.14+, 16.0+, and 18.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.
